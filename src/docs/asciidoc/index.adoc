[[overview]]
= Overview

[[overview-the-project]]
== The Project
The project consist on a middleware async-reactive server **POC (Proof Of Concept)**, that manages the communication between two different actors:

* **Requester**: The server "client", it sends request to our server.
* **Provider**: The third-party provider. We act as their clients, asking them for survey information.

.The services we provide to the requester can be separated in two main blocks:

* **surveys**: The requester can:
** ask for a survey catalog based on the desired criteria
** consult a survey knowing it id.
** get the results of the survey's (Not the scope of the project sample)
* **subscriptions**: The requester can subscribe a survey-catalog request to have a periodic updated "catalog reception"

== The technologies

The main tech-stack is: **SpringBoot (with Groovy) + Webflux**

Additionally, some tools are being used:

* H2 (for an in-memory db)
* Guava
* ModelMapper


And finally, for the tests + docs generation: *WebtestClient + Spring RestDocs*.


== Try-it yourself

==== Execution
You can try the project and the request executing the server. To execute it there are several ways:

* **Build-it yourself**: You can build the project with ease, for it you must open a console in the root folder of the project and execute:
```
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

> This order will automatically execute the automated tests (building the docs) and executing the server.

* **Execute the https://github.com/NemesisMate/caravelotrial/releases/download/alpha/caravelotrial-0.0.1-ALPHA.jar[provided jar]**
```
java -jar <JAR_NAME>.jar
```


==== Access

Now, (once the server is up) to manually test the project you can go the the generated documentation under: `http://localhost:8080/docs/index.html` and execute any of the example
curl orders for every resource.


[[resources]]
= Resources

[[resources-index]]
== Index

The index provides the entry point into the service. As we don't have any index, it will give you a 404.

[[resources-index-access]]
=== Accessing the index

A `GET` request is used to access the index.

[[resources-surveys]]
== Surveys REST Service

[[resources-surveys-get]]
=== Getting a survey catalog (GET)

A `GET` request is used to fetch the available surveys matching the requested conditions. A `POST` request can also be used if adding the `X-HTTP-Method-Override: GET` header.

==== Examples

===== CURL request

include::{snippets}/available-surveys-get-example/curl-request.adoc[]

===== HTTP request

include::{snippets}/available-surveys-get-example/http-request.adoc[]

===== HTTP response

include::{snippets}/available-surveys-get-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[resources-survey-get]]
=== Fetching a survey (GET)

A `GET` request is used to fetch a survey. For it, the provider id is also needed as the survey's id is provider-relative.

==== Examples

===== CURL request

include::{snippets}/survey-get-example/curl-request.adoc[]

===== HTTP request

include::{snippets}/survey-get-example/http-request.adoc[]

===== HTTP response

include::{snippets}/survey-get-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[resources-subscription-post]]
=== Creating a subscription (POST)

A `POST` request is used to create a new subscription. To try the system, a `LOG`-channel with a `MINUTELY` frequency subscription can be created (which will show the catalog in the console every minute).

==== Examples

===== CURL request

include::{snippets}/subscription-post-example/curl-request.adoc[]

===== HTTP request

include::{snippets}/subscription-post-example/http-request.adoc[]

===== HTTP response

include::{snippets}/subscription-post-example/http-response.adoc[]
